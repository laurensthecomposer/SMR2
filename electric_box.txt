what we need to think about when making the electric box:

    how big does the electric box needs to be 
        around 300 x 150 x 150

    what comes in the electric box
        arduino
        breadbord
        2 conveyerbelt powering supplies

    where do we put the box
        left of the bulk feeder. Wires are leaveing at the bottem of the box and are going in the black box through a hol

    how are the wires managed 
        there are coming wires in and out
        in:
            3 conveyer wires
            arduino cable
            Powersupply inside?
            grounding metal frame
        out:
            light cable?
            light gate sensor            
            servo bulkfeeder

    where comes the laptop (for usb cable)
        on top or in the front

    how do we put the light on and off
        main switch outside wich powers the light and the Powersupply
        light switch in the electric box seperate from Powersupply

    How do we ground the light
        ground the metal frame in the black box
